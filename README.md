## üñ•Ô∏è DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS

#### [PROJECT 1: Income Groups Prediction Model on a Data from a Survey on Income and Expenditure](https://github.com/naqibasri/Income-Groups-Prediction-Model)
* Designed a predictive model to determine the income groups of the respondents based on their personal data.  
* Developed comprehensive & in-depth descriptive analytics and insight on the relationship between the income groups and other categorical and numerical attributes.  
* Performed data cleaning, feature engineering to prepare it for classification machine learning application.  
* ML algorithms such as LogReg, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM are applied to choose the best prediction model.  
* Build predictsalary() function where the input arguments are the model object & test data for collaboration purpose.

#### [PPROJECT 2: Target Market Analysis Using Supervised ML From Customers' Historical Purchase Data](https://github.com/naqibasri/Target-Market-Analysis---JDS-Capstone)
* Designed a predictive model to determine the potential customers who will purchase after we send an advertisement.
* Performed data cleaning, feature engineering to prepare it for classification machine learning application.
* ML algorithms such as LogReg, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM are applied to choose the best prediction model.

#### [PROJECT 3: Hotel Booking Demand Analysis Cancelation Prediction](https://github.com/naqibasri/Hotel-Booking-Demand-Analysis-Cancelation-prediction)
* Developed comprehensive & in-depth descriptive analytics and insight from both the hotel owner and guest perspective.
* Design a predictive model to predict bookings cancellation using classification machine learning.
* ML algorithms such as LogReg, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM are applied to choose the best prediction model.

#### [PROJECT 4: Rotating Machine Predictive Maintenance Using Classification Machine Learning](https://github.com/naqibasri/Machine-Predictive-Maintenance-Using-Classification-Machine-Learning)
* Built ML model to predict failure and failure type for rotating machine based on process data and machine specification.
* Performed data cleaning, feature engineering to prepare it for classification machine learning application.
* The imbalanced dataset is solved through the usage of Undersampling (NearMiss) and Oversampling (SMOTE).

#### [PROJECT 5: Mechanical Properties Prediction of Low Alloy Steels Based on Material Compositions](https://github.com/naqibasri/Mechanical-properties-prediction-of-low-alloy-steels-based-on-their-material-compositions-by-weight-)
* Linear Regression, XGB, Random Forest, Ridge, and Lasso Regressor are applied to choose the best prediction model.
* Random Forest Regression has shown the best performance for this task.
* Data scaling, outliers removal, and skewness amendment have sensibly improved the performance.

#### [PROJECT 6: Maintenance Interval Prediction From E-coating Ultrafiltration Maintenance Dataset](https://github.com/naqibasri/E-coating-ultrafiltration-maintenance)
* Design a predictive model to determine the maintenance interval based on an industry case study from an electrophoresis painting plant where deployed an IIoT system.
* Linear Regression, XGB, Random Forest, Ridge, and Lasso Regressor are applied to choose the best prediction model.
