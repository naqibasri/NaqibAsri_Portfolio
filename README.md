# [PROJECT 1: Income Groups Prediction Model on a Data from a Survey on Income and Expenditure](https://github.com/naqibasri/Income-Groups-Prediction-Model)
* Designed a predictive model to determine the income groups of the respondents based on their personal data.  
* Developed comprehensive & in-depth descriptive analytics and insight on the relationship between the income groups and other categorical and numerical attributes.  
* Performed data cleaning, feature engineering to prepare it for classification machine learning application.  
* ML algorithms such as LogReg, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM are applied to choose the best prediction model.  
* Build predictsalary() function where the input arguments are the model object & test data for collaboration purpose.

# [PPROJECT 2: Target Market Analysis Using Supervised Machine Learning From Customers' Historical Purchase Data](https://github.com/naqibasri/Target-Market-Analysis---JDS-Capstone)
* Designed a predictive model to determine the potential customers who will purchase after we send an advertisement.
* Performed data cleaning, feature engineering to prepare it for classification machine learning application.
* ML algorithms such as LogReg, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM are applied to choose the best prediction model.
